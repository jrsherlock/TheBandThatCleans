```jsx
{/* Edit Button - Only for admins */}

  <div className="mb-4">

      onClick={() => onEditClick(lot.id)}
      aria-label={`Edit details for ${lot.name}`}

  </button>
)}
```

**Result:** The "Edit Details" button no longer appears in the mobile list view cards.

## 🔧 What Was Preserved

### ✅ Edit Modal Functionality Still Works
The underlying edit functionality is **still available** through:
- The `LotEditModal` component (lines 877-883)
- The `handleEditClick` function (lines 607-611)
- The `canEditDetails` permission check (line 877)

**Why this matters:** The edit modal can still be triggered programmatically or through other UI elements if needed in the future. The infrastructure is intact.

### ✅ Variables Not Removed
The following variables were **intentionally kept** because they're still used:
- `canEditDetails` - Used to control modal visibility (line 877)
- `onEditClick` - Still passed as a prop to components (lines 811, 843)
- `handleEditClick` - Still defined and used internally (lines 607-611)

**Why this matters:** These variables support the modal system and may be used by other features or future enhancements.

## 🚀 Future Considerations

### If Edit Functionality Needs to Be Restored
If you need to restore the ability to edit lot details in the future, you can:

1. **Add a new UI element** (e.g., icon button, context menu, double-click)
2. **Call `handleEditClick(lotId)`** to open the modal
3. **The modal infrastructure is already in place** and ready to use

### Alternative Edit Triggers
Consider these alternatives if edit functionality is needed:
- **Double-click on lot card** to open edit modal
- **Context menu (right-click)** with "Edit Details" option
- **Icon button in card header** (pencil icon)
- **Dedicated "Edit Mode"** toggle in the UI
