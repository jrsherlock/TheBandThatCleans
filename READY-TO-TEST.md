## Troubleshooting

### "This site can't be reached"
- Make sure ngrok is running
- Check you copied the full HTTPS URL
- Try refreshing the page

### "Blocked request" error
- This should be fixed now!
- If you still see it, make sure you restarted the dev server
- Check that vite.config.js has the allowedHosts configuration

### "AR not supported"
- Make sure you're using Safari (not Chrome)
- Ensure your iPhone is 6S or newer
- Check that you're using the HTTPS URL (not HTTP)

### Camera permission denied
- Go to Settings → Safari → Camera → Ask
- Refresh the page
- Try in a private browsing tab

### AR tracking is poor
- Ensure good lighting
- Point at a textured surface (carpet, wood floor)
- Avoid plain white surfaces
- Move the phone slowly

## Tips for Best Experience

### Lighting
✅ Well-lit room  
✅ Natural daylight  
❌ Direct sunlight  
❌ Very dark rooms  

### Surfaces
✅ Textured (carpet, wood)  
✅ Horizontal (floor, table)  
❌ Plain white  
❌ Reflective (glass, mirrors)  

### Device
✅ Close other apps  
✅ Good battery level  
✅ Keep device cool  

## When You're Done Testing

### Stop ngrok
In the terminal running ngrok, press `Ctrl+C`

### Stop dev server
In the terminal running `npm run dev`, press `Ctrl+C`

## Next Time You Test

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Start ngrok: `ngrok http 3000`
3. Use the NEW ngrok URL (it changes each time)

**Tip:** Keep both running to maintain the same URL!

## Share with Your Team

You can share the ngrok URL with other team members for testing:
- They can access it from any device
- They don't need to be on your WiFi
- The URL works until you stop ngrok
