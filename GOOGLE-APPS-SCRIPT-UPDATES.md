- `aiStudentCount` - Student count from AI analysis
- `aiConfidence` - AI confidence level (high/medium/low)
- `aiAnalysisTimestamp` - When AI analysis was performed
- `countSource` - Source of count ("ai" or "manual")
- `countEnteredBy` - User who uploaded/entered count
- `manualCountOverride` - Manual override if AI was incorrect

### 2. ‚úÖ New Handler Function Added
**Lines 788-909**: Added `handleSignInSheetUpload(payload)` function that:

**Accepts payload with:**
- `lotId` (required) - ID of the parking lot
- `aiCount` (optional) - Student count from AI analysis
- `manualCount` (optional) - Manual student count entry
- `aiConfidence` (optional) - AI confidence level
- `countSource` (optional) - "ai" or "manual"
- `enteredBy` (optional) - Name of user who submitted
- `imageData` (optional) - Base64 encoded image

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Function not found" error
- Make sure you saved the code before deploying
- Verify the function name is exactly `handleSignInSheetUpload`

- Ensure payload includes `lotId`
- Include either `aiCount` or `manualCount`

### Data not appearing in sheet
- Check that all 6 new columns exist in the Lots sheet
- Verify column headers match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check Apps Script execution logs for errors

### Image not storing
- Verify imageData is base64 encoded
- Check image size (Google Sheets has cell size limits)
- Consider compressing images before upload
