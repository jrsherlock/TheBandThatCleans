# Hybrid Check-In System with AI-Driven Auto Check-In

## Overview

The TBTC application now implements a **hybrid check-in system** that synchronizes physical sign-in sheets with the digital check-in system using AI-powered name extraction and fuzzy matching.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **AI-Powered Auto Check-In:** Automatically checks in students when sign-in sheets are uploaded
- ‚úÖ **Fuzzy Name Matching:** Handles variations, nicknames, and misspellings (85% similarity threshold)
- ‚úÖ **Placeholder Students:** Creates temporary records for unmatched signatures
- ‚úÖ **Manual Reconciliation:** Directors can match placeholders to actual students
- ‚úÖ **Accurate Counts:** Dashboard and Students screen counts always match
- ‚úÖ **Manual Check-In Fallback:** Available for exception cases

---

## How It Works

### 1. Primary Check-In Method: AI-Processed Sign-In Sheets

When a director uploads a sign-in sheet photo via `uploadSignInSheet()`:

#### **Step 1: AI Processing**
- Google Vision API extracts student names from the image using OCR
- Counts total signatures detected on the sheet
- Returns array of extracted names

#### **Step 2: Fuzzy Name Matching**
- Each extracted name is compared against the master student roster
- Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm with **85% similarity threshold**
- Handles variations:
  - Misspellings: "Jon Doe" ‚Üí "John Doe"
  - Nicknames: "Mike Smith" ‚Üí "Michael Smith"
  - Middle names: "John A. Doe" ‚Üí "John Doe"
  - Case differences: "JOHN DOE" ‚Üí "John Doe"

#### **Step 3: Auto Check-In Matched Students**
For each successfully matched student:
- ‚úÖ Set `student.checkedIn = true`
- ‚úÖ Set `student.checkInTime = <timestamp of sheet upload>`
- ‚úÖ Set `student.assignedLot = <lot ID from the uploaded sheet>`
- ‚úÖ Set `student.matchedByAI = true` (tracking flag)
- ‚úÖ Set `student.extractedNameText = <original OCR text>` (for audit trail)

#### **Step 4: Create Placeholder Students**
For signatures that cannot be matched (illegible handwriting, unknown students, etc.):
- Create temporary placeholder record:
  - `id: "placeholder-lot48-1"` (unique per lot)
  - `name: "Lot 48 - Unidentified #1"` (friendly display name)
  - `checkedIn: true`
  - `checkInTime: <timestamp of sheet upload>`
  - `assignedLot: <lot ID>`
  - `isPlaceholder: true` (flag for identification)
  - `extractedNameText: <raw OCR text>` (for manual reconciliation)
  - `requiresReconciliation: true`

#### **Step 5: Update Lot Statistics**
- `lot.aiStudentCount = <total signatures detected>`
- `lot.matchedStudentCount = <number of successfully matched students>`
- `lot.placeholderStudentCount = <number of placeholder students created>`
- **Invariant:** `aiStudentCount = matchedStudentCount + placeholderStudentCount`

---

### 2. Secondary Check-In Method: Manual Check-In

**When to Use:**
- Students present but unable to sign the physical sheet (injured hand, forgot pen)
- Students who forgot to sign the sheet
- Late arrivals after sheets were already uploaded
- Correcting AI matching errors

**How It Works:**
- Use existing manual check-in interface in `StudentsScreen.jsx`
- Button labeled: **"Manual Check-In (Exception Cases Only)"**
- Sets `student.manualCheckIn = true` to distinguish from AI check-ins
- Sets `student.matchedByAI = false`

---

## Expected Outcome

### ‚úÖ Accurate Lot-Level Counts

**Dashboard "Students Checked In" count:**
- Sum of all `lot.aiStudentCount` values
- Includes both matched students AND placeholder students

**Students Screen "Checked In Today" count:**
- Count of all students where `checkedIn = true`
- Includes matched students, placeholder students, AND manual check-ins

**Both counts ALWAYS match** (eliminating the previous 28-student discrepancy)

### ‚úÖ Individual Student Accountability

**Matched Students:**
- Fully identified and checked in
- Marked with ü§ñ "AI Matched" badge
- Can be checked out normally

**Placeholder Students:**
- Counted in totals but require manual reconciliation
- Marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è "Requires Reconciliation" badge
- Show extracted OCR text for reference
- Cannot be checked out until reconciled

**Manual Check-Ins:**
- Marked with ‚úã "Manual" badge
- Clearly distinguished from AI check-ins

---

## Reconciliation Workflow

### Director View:

1. **Navigate to Students Screen**
2. **See placeholder students** with ‚ö†Ô∏è "Requires Reconciliation" badge
3. **Click "Match to Student" button**
4. **View extracted OCR text:** e.g., "Jon Doe"
5. **Search roster** for similar names
6. **Select correct student:** e.g., "John Doe"
7. **Confirm merge**
8. **Placeholder deleted**, real student marked as checked in

### Reconciliation Modal Features:

- Shows placeholder information (extracted name, lot, check-in time)
- Search box with real-time filtering
- Only shows students who are NOT already checked in
- Only shows non-placeholder students
- Click student to reconcile (one-click operation)

---

## Data Structure

### Student Object (Enhanced)

```javascript
{
  id: "student-123" | "placeholder-lot48-1",
  name: "John Doe" | "Lot 48 - Unidentified #1",
  instrument: "Trumpet",
  section: "Brass",
  grade: "10",
  checkedIn: true,
  checkInTime: "2025-10-13T14:30:00Z",
  assignedLot: "lot-48",
  
  // New AI check-in tracking fields:
  matchedByAI: true | false,           // Was this student matched by AI?
  manualCheckIn: true | false,         // Was this a manual check-in?
  isPlaceholder: true | false,         // Is this a placeholder student?
  extractedNameText: "Jon Doe",        // Raw OCR text (for audit/reconciliation)
  requiresReconciliation: true | false // Needs manual matching?
}
```

### Lot Object (Enhanced)

```javascript
{
  id: "lot-48",
  name: "Lot 48",
  status: "in-progress",
  aiStudentCount: 13,              // Total signatures detected
  matchedStudentCount: 10,         // Successfully matched students
  placeholderStudentCount: 3,      // Unmatched signatures (placeholders)
  signInSheetUploadTime: "2025-10-13T14:30:00Z",
  signInSheetImageUrl: "https://drive.google.com/..."
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Dashboard and Students screen counts don't match**
- A: Check console logs for discrepancy details
- A: Verify all sign-in sheets have been uploaded with `studentNames` array
- A: Check for students manually checked in without signing sheets

**Q: Placeholder student won't reconcile**
- A: Verify actual student is not already checked in
- A: Check that actual student exists in roster
- A: Try refreshing the page and reconciling again

**Q: AI matching is too aggressive (false matches)**
- A: Increase threshold in `findBestMatch()` from 0.85 to 0.90
- A: Review matched students and manually correct if needed

**Q: AI matching is too conservative (too many placeholders)**
- A: Decrease threshold in `findBestMatch()` from 0.85 to 0.80
- A: Improve OCR quality by uploading higher-resolution images
