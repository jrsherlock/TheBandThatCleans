#### 1. Generate QR Codes (30 minutes)
```bash
# You need 23 QR codes total:
# - 22 check-in QR codes (one per parking lot)
# - 1 master check-out QR code

# Use this website: https://www.qr-code-generator.com/

# Check-in URLs (replace with your actual Google Sites URL):
https://sites.google.com/view/tbtc-cleanup#checkin/lot-1
https://sites.google.com/view/tbtc-cleanup#checkin/lot-2
...
https://sites.google.com/view/tbtc-cleanup#checkin/lot-22
