## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the edit button"
**Cause:** You're logged in as a volunteer or student  
**Solution:** Only admins can edit. Switch to an admin user to test editing.

### "I can't check students in"
**Cause:** You're logged in as a volunteer or student  
**Solution:** Only admins can check students in/out. Switch to an admin user.

### "The charts aren't showing"
**Cause:** You're logged in as a volunteer or student  
**Solution:** Full charts only show for admins. Volunteers see simplified view.

### "I see 'Read Only' everywhere"
**Cause:** You're logged in as a volunteer or student  
**Solution:** This is correct! Volunteers and students have read-only access.

### "Old screens are still there"
**Cause:** Old components are commented out but still in code  
**Solution:** This is intentional for transition period. They'll be removed after testing.
