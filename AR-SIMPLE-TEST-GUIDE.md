# AR Simple Test Guide

## 🧪 Testing the Crash Fix

I've created **two versions** for you to test:

### Version 1: Full AR Game (Fixed)
**File:** `public/ar-cleanup-game.html`
**Features:** Complete game with bin placement, trash throwing, scoring
**Status:** ✅ All crash bugs fixed

### Version 2: Simple AR Test (New)
**File:** `public/ar-test-simple.html`
**Features:** Minimal AR test - just shows a green box in AR
**Status:** ✅ Perfect for debugging

---

## 🎯 Which Version to Test First?

### Start with Simple Test (Recommended)

**Why?**
- Minimal code = easier to debug
- Shows detailed logs on screen
- Confirms basic AR works
- Identifies exact failure point

**How to access:**
```
1. Open your ngrok URL on Android
2. Add /ar-test-simple.html to the URL
   Example: https://xxxxxxxx.ngrok-free.app/ar-test-simple.html
3. Click "Start AR Test"
4. Watch the logs on screen
```

### Then Test Full Game

**After simple test works:**
```
1. Go back to main TBTC app
2. Click "AR Game" tab
3. Click "Launch AR Game"
4. Test full functionality
```

## 🐛 Debugging Workflow

### If Simple Test Works but Full Game Crashes:

**1. Check browser console:**
```
Android Chrome:
1. Connect phone to computer via USB
2. Computer: chrome://inspect
3. Find device → Inspect
4. Check Console tab for errors
```

**2. Look for specific errors:**
- Hit testing errors → Expected, fallback should work
- Bin placement errors → Should use fallback
- Trash throwing errors → Check touch events

**3. Share the logs:**
- Copy console output
- Share with me for analysis

---

### If Simple Test Also Crashes:

**1. Check the on-screen logs:**
- What's the last ✅ message?
- What's the first ❌ message?
- Copy the error details

**2. Verify device compatibility:**
```
Required:
✅ Android 8.0+
✅ Chrome 79+
✅ ARCore installed
✅ Camera permissions
✅ HTTPS connection
```

**3. Try different device:**
- Test on another Android phone
- Verify ARCore support: https://developers.google.com/ar/devices
