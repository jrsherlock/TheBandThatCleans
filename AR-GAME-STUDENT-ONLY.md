# AR Game - Student Only Access

## ✅ Changes Applied

The AR Game tab is now **only available to students**.

---

## 🔒 Permission System

### New Permission Added:
**File:** `src/utils/permissions.js`

```javascript
// AR Game Permissions
canPlayARGame: (user) => {
  // Only students can access the AR game
  return user?.role === USER_ROLES.STUDENT;
},
```

### Navigation Updated:
**File:** `app.jsx`

```javascript
const navItems = () => {
  const allItems = [
    { id: "dashboard", label: "Dashboard", icon: Calendar, requiredPermission: "canViewDashboard" },
    { id: "lots", label: "Parking Lots", icon: MapPin, requiredPermission: "canViewParkingLots" },
    { id: "students", label: "Students", icon: Users, requiredPermission: "canViewStudents" },
    { id: "argame", label: "AR Game", icon: Gamepad2, requiredPermission: "canPlayARGame" }, // Students only
  ];

  // Filter items based on permissions
  return allItems.filter(item => {
    if (!item.requiredPermission) return true;
    return hasPermission(currentUser, item.requiredPermission);
  });
};
```

## 🧪 Testing the Permission

### Step 1: Test as Student (Jameson Sherlock)

**1. Open the app:**
```
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app
```

**2. Select user:**
- Click user dropdown (top right)
- Select "Jameson Sherlock - Student"

**3. Verify AR Game tab is visible:**
```
Navigation should show:
- Dashboard
- Parking Lots
- AR Game ✅
```

**4. Click AR Game tab:**
- Should load AR Game Launcher
- Can click "Launch AR Game"

---

### Step 2: Test as Admin (Aaron Ottmar)

**1. Select user:**
- Click user dropdown
- Select "Aaron Ottmar - Director"

**2. Verify AR Game tab is hidden:**
```
Navigation should show:
- Dashboard
- Parking Lots
- Students
(No AR Game tab) ❌
```

---

### Step 3: Test as Volunteer

**1. Select user:**

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### For Students:
- ✅ Can see AR Game tab
- ✅ Can launch AR game
- ✅ Can play the game on compatible devices
- ✅ Tab appears in navigation bar

### For Admins (Directors):
- ❌ Cannot see AR Game tab
- ❌ Tab is filtered out of navigation
- ✅ Can see all other tabs (Dashboard, Parking Lots, Students)

### For Volunteers (Parents):
- ❌ Cannot see AR Game tab
- ❌ Tab is filtered out of navigation
- ✅ Can see Dashboard and Parking Lots

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Permission Check Flow:

**1. Navigation Items Defined:**
```javascript
{ id: "argame", label: "AR Game", icon: Gamepad2, requiredPermission: "canPlayARGame" }
```

**2. Permission Filter Applied:**
```javascript
return allItems.filter(item => {
  if (!item.requiredPermission) return true;
  return hasPermission(currentUser, item.requiredPermission);
});
```

**3. Permission Function Checked:**
```javascript
canPlayARGame: (user) => {
  return user?.role === USER_ROLES.STUDENT;
}
```

**4. Result:**
- If `user.role === 'student'` → Tab visible ✅
- If `user.role === 'admin'` → Tab hidden ❌
- If `user.role === 'volunteer'` → Tab hidden ❌

## 🚀 Live Testing

### Quick Test Steps:

**1. Start dev server (if not running):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**2. Start ngrok (if not running):**
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

**3. Open ngrok URL on any device:**
```
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app
```

**4. Switch between users:**
- Use the user dropdown in top right
- Watch the navigation tabs change
- AR Game tab only appears for Jameson Sherlock

## 💡 Why Student-Only?

The AR Game is designed as a **fun, educational reward** for students who participate in the parking lot cleanup program. By making it student-only:

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Gamifies the cleanup experience for students
- ✅ Provides incentive for participation
- ✅ Keeps admin/volunteer interfaces focused on management tasks
- ✅ Creates a special feature just for students
- ✅ Encourages student engagement with the app

**Design Philosophy:**
- Admins and volunteers focus on **management and coordination**
- Students focus on **participation and engagement**
- AR Game is a **student engagement tool**, not a management tool

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Permission Enforcement:

**Frontend (UI Level):**
- ✅ Tab is hidden from navigation for non-students
- ✅ User cannot click what they cannot see

**Backend (Future Enhancement):**
- 🔄 When backend is implemented, add server-side permission check
- 🔄 Verify user role before serving AR game content
- 🔄 Return 403 Forbidden if non-student tries to access directly

**Current Implementation:**
- Frontend-only permission check
- Sufficient for current mock user system
- Should be enhanced when real authentication is added
