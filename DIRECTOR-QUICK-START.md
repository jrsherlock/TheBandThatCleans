## 🎨 Tips for Best Results

### Taking Good Photos
- ✅ **Good lighting** - Natural light or bright indoor lighting
- ✅ **Clear focus** - Make sure names are readable
- ✅ **Straight angle** - Hold camera parallel to sheet
- ✅ **Full sheet visible** - Capture all student names
- ❌ **Avoid shadows** - Don't block light with your hand
- ❌ **Avoid glare** - Adjust angle if sheet is glossy

### If OCR Count is Wrong
- **Manual Override**: You can always adjust the count manually
- **Common Issues**:
  - Messy handwriting → OCR may miss names
  - Poor lighting → OCR may be inaccurate
  - Crossed-out names → OCR may count them
- **Solution**: Just type the correct number and save
