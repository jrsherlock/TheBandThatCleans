## 🔍 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Bulk Upload Maximum Count
**Before:** "Upload up to 21 sign-in sheets"  
**After:** "Upload up to 18 sign-in sheets"  
**Reason:** Parking lot consolidation reduced total count from 21 to 18

### Issue 2: Documentation Added
**New:** Comprehensive guide for fixing lot name display issues  
**Location:** `Docs/LOT-NAME-DISPLAY-FIX.md`  
**Purpose:** Help user fix Google Sheet column header mismatch

## ⚠️ Manual Action Still Required

### Google Sheet Column Header Fix

**The deployment does NOT include the Google Sheet fix - you must do this manually:**

1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mKnHPzGZDMa54aYyaKUbYYihZw9pRdwE3wr_J5EDRys/edit
2. Go to the "Lots" tab
3. Click on cell **B1** (currently says "lot")
4. Change it to: **name**
5. Press Enter to save

**Why This Is Needed:**
- The application code expects column B to be labeled "name"
- Your Google Sheet currently has it labeled "lot"
- This mismatch causes `lot.name` to be empty
- Bulk actions dropdown shows " - Ready" instead of "Lot 3 - Library Lot - Ready"

**After Fixing:**
- Refresh your application
- Lot names will appear correctly in all dropdowns and displays
