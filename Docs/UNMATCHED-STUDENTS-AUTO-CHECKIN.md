# Unmatched Students Auto Check-In Feature

## Overview
When processing sign-in sheet uploads with the enhanced OCR feature, any student names that cannot be matched against the ActualRoster (similarity score below 70% threshold) are now **automatically added to the Students tab** with placeholder values, ensuring all students who signed in are checked in and counted.

## Previous Behavior ‚ùå

**Before this update:**
- Students whose names couldn't be matched were reported as "unmatched"
- They were NOT added to the Students tab
- They were NOT checked in
- Student count could be inaccurate
- Directors had to manually add these students

**Problems:**
- Missing students in the system
- Inaccurate attendance records
- Extra manual work for Directors
- Potential for students to be overlooked

## New Behavior ‚úÖ

**After this update:**
- All extracted student names are added to the Students tab
- Matched students get full roster data (instrument, section, year)
- Unmatched students get placeholder values for manual review
- All students are checked in automatically
- Student count is 100% accurate

## Implementation Details

### Unmatched Student Data Structure

When a student name cannot be matched to the ActualRoster, a new row is created in the Students tab with:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `id` | `unmatched-{timestamp}-{index}` | Unique identifier (e.g., "unmatched-1697123456789-0") |
| `name` | Extracted name | Exactly as it appears on sign-in sheet |
| `instrument` | `"Band Student"` | Placeholder value indicating manual review needed |
| `section` | `"Band Student"` | Placeholder value indicating manual review needed |
| `year` | `""` | Empty string (unknown grade level) |
| `checkedIn` | `true` | Student is checked in |
| `checkInTime` | Current timestamp | When the sign-in sheet was uploaded |
| `assignedLot` | Lot ID | The lot where student signed in |

### Example

**Sign-in sheet contains:**
- "Smith, John" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Matched to ActualRoster (95% confidence)
- "Doe, Jane" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Matched to ActualRoster (88% confidence)
- "Illegible Name" ‚Üí ‚ùå No match found (below 70% threshold)

**Students tab after processing:**

| id | name | instrument | section | year | checkedIn | checkInTime | assignedLot |
|----|------|------------|---------|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| student-42 | Smith, John | Trumpet | MB | 10 | true | 2025-10-12T15:30:00Z | 101 |
| student-89 | Doe, Jane | Clarinet | CB | 11 | true | 2025-10-12T15:30:00Z | 101 |
| unmatched-1697123456789-0 | Illegible Name | Band Student | Band Student | | true | 2025-10-12T15:30:00Z | 101 |

## User Experience

### Frontend Toast Notifications

**Success message (with matches):**
```
‚úÖ Library Lot: 10 students recorded
üìã Matched 9 students (90% match rate)
```

**Info message (with unmatched):**
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è 1 name(s) added as "Band Student" - please review and update
```

**Visual Design:**
- Blue background (#3b82f6)
- White text
- Info icon (‚ÑπÔ∏è)
- 7-second duration
- Non-intrusive notification style

### Director Workflow

1. **Upload sign-in sheet** ‚Üí All students checked in automatically
2. **Review notification** ‚Üí See how many students need manual review
3. **Open Students tab** ‚Üí Filter by "Band Student" to find unmatched entries
4. **Update student info** ‚Üí Manually correct instrument, section, year
5. **Update student ID** ‚Üí Optionally match to correct roster ID

## Why This Approach?

   - Can be used to identify student later
   - Helps with handwriting interpretation

4. **Flexible Review Process**

### Alternative Approaches Considered

‚ùå **Don't add unmatched students**
- Problem: Missing students, inaccurate counts

‚ùå **Add with empty instrument/section**
- Problem: Harder to identify which students need review

‚ùå **Require manual matching before check-in**
- Problem: Slows down the upload process, extra work

‚úÖ **Add with "Band Student" placeholder** (CHOSEN)
- Automatic check-in + easy identification + flexible review

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Handwriting is Illegible
**Sign-in sheet:** "Smudged name"  
**Result:** Added as "Smudged name" with "Band Student" placeholder  
**Director action:** Review sign-in sheet image, identify student, update record

### Scenario 2: Student Not in Roster
**Sign-in sheet:** "Guest Student, John"  
**Result:** Added as "Guest Student, John" with "Band Student" placeholder  
**Director action:** Verify if guest or missing from roster, update accordingly

### Scenario 3: Name Misspelled on Sheet
**Sign-in sheet:** "Smyth, John" (should be "Smith, John")  
**Result:** If similarity < 70%, added as "Smyth, John" with "Band Student"  
**Director action:** Recognize misspelling, update to correct student ID

### Scenario 4: Nickname Used
**Sign-in sheet:** "Johnny Smith" (roster has "John Smith")  
**Result:** May not match if too different, added with "Band Student"  
**Director action:** Identify as nickname, update to correct student ID

## Finding Unmatched Students

### In Google Sheets

**Filter by instrument:**
1. Open Students tab
2. Click filter icon on "instrument" column
3. Select "Band Student"
4. Review and update each entry

**Filter by section:**
1. Open Students tab
2. Click filter icon on "section" column

## API Response Structure

The backend returns detailed information about matched and unmatched students:

```javascript
{
  success: true,
  lotId: "101",
  studentCount: 10,
  studentMatching: {
    totalExtracted: 10,
    matched: 9,           // Students matched to roster
    unmatched: 1,         // Students added with placeholder
    duplicates: 0,        // Duplicate names on sheet
    matchRate: 90,        // Percentage matched
    matchedStudents: [
      {
        extractedName: "Smith, John",
        student: { id: "student-42", name: "Smith, John", ... },
        score: 0.95,
        confidence: "exact"
      },
      ...
    ],
    unmatchedNames: [
      "Illegible Name"    // These were added with "Band Student"
    ],
    duplicateMatches: []
  }
}
```

## Backend Implementation

### Code Location
`Code.gs` ‚Üí `processStudentNames()` function

### Key Code Section
```javascript
// Process unmatched students - add them with placeholder values
if (unmatched.length > 0) {
  const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
  
  for (let i = 0; i < unmatched.length; i++) {
    const unmatchedName = unmatched[i];
    
    // Generate unique ID for unmatched student
    const unmatchedId = `unmatched-${timestamp}-${i}`;
    
    // Create new row with placeholder values
    const newRow = [];
    newRow[idIndex] = unmatchedId;
    newRow[nameIndex] = unmatchedName;
    newRow[instrumentIndex] = 'Band Student';
    newRow[sectionIndex] = 'Band Student';
    newRow[yearIndex] = '';
    newRow[checkedInIndex] = true;
    newRow[checkInTimeIndex] = checkInTime;
    newRow[assignedLotIndex] = lotId;
    
    studentsData.push(newRow);
  }
}
```

- Train students to write clearly

### Issue: Can't find unmatched students
**Solution:**
- Filter by "Band Student" in instrument or section column
- Search for "unmatched-" in ID column
- Check that Students tab has data

### Issue: Duplicate unmatched entries
**Possible cause:**
- Same sign-in sheet uploaded twice

**Solution:**
- Check timestamps in ID
- Delete duplicate entries
- Avoid re-uploading same sheet
