## 2. Mock User Data Updates

### User Names Changed

**Before:**
```javascript
const mockUsers = [
  { id: "user-1", name: "Director Smith", role: "admin", email: "director.smith@school.edu" },
  { id: "user-2", name: "Director Johnson", role: "admin", email: "director.johnson@school.edu" },
  { id: "user-3", name: "Parent Volunteer", role: "volunteer", email: "volunteer@parent.com" },
  { id: "student-1", name: "Emma Johnson", role: "student", email: "emma.j@student.edu" }
];
```

**After:**
```javascript
const mockUsers = [
  { id: "user-1", name: "Aaron Ottmar - Director", role: "admin", email: "aaron.ottmar@school.edu" },
  { id: "user-2", name: "Mike Kowbel - Director", role: "admin", email: "mike.kowbel@school.edu" },
  { id: "user-3", name: "Parent Volunteer", role: "volunteer", email: "volunteer@parent.com" },
  { id: "student-1", name: "Jameson Sherlock - Student", role: "student", email: "jameson.sherlock@student.edu" }
];
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Director 1: "Director Smith" → "Aaron Ottmar - Director"
- ✅ Director 2: "Director Johnson" → "Mike Kowbel - Director"
- ✅ Student: "Emma Johnson" → "Jameson Sherlock - Student"
- ✅ Email addresses updated to match new names

---

### Mock Lot Data Updated

**Before:**
```javascript
updatedBy: Math.random() > 0.5 ? "Director Smith" : "Director Johnson"
```

**After:**
```javascript
updatedBy: Math.random() > 0.5 ? "Aaron Ottmar - Director" : "Mike Kowbel - Director"
```

This ensures consistency when lot update history is displayed.

---

## 3. Student Dashboard Personalization

The Student Dashboard already uses `currentUser.name` for personalization, so when "Jameson Sherlock - Student" is selected from the user dropdown:

**Welcome Message:**
```jsx
<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Welcome, {currentUser.name}!</h1>
```

**Displays as:**
```
Welcome, Jameson Sherlock - Student!
```

No additional changes were needed - the personalization works automatically with the updated mock user data.

---

## 4. Responsive Design Verification

### Tailwind Breakpoints Used

All logo sizes now use responsive classes:

| Breakpoint | Screen Width | Logo Sizes |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| **Default (Mobile)** | < 640px | Smaller base sizes |
| **sm:** | ≥ 640px | Medium sizes |
| **md:** | ≥ 768px | Full 2x sizes |

### Mobile Optimization Features

1. **Flexible Sizing:**
   - Logos start smaller on mobile (e.g., h-20 instead of h-32)
   - Gradually increase at larger breakpoints
   - Prevents overflow and layout breaks

2. **Text Responsiveness:**
   - Titles and subtitles scale with screen size
   - Maintains readability on small screens
   - Prevents text wrapping issues

3. **Flex Shrink Prevention:**
   - Added `flex-shrink-0` to logos and icons
   - Prevents compression when space is tight
   - Maintains logo aspect ratio

4. **Container Padding:**
   - Added padding to prevent edge overflow
   - Ensures logos don't touch screen edges
   - Better visual spacing on mobile
