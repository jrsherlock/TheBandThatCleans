# AI-Assisted Student Check-Ins Feature Summary

## 📋 Overview

This feature enables Parent Volunteers and Admin/Director users to process physical sign-in sheets using AI-powered image recognition via Google's Gemini API. The system automatically counts students from uploaded photos of the 22 parking lot sign-in sheets per cleanup event.

---

## 🎯 Feature Capabilities

### What Users Can Do

**Parent Volunteers & Admins:**
1. Upload photos of physical sign-in sheets (one per parking lot)
2. Let AI automatically count students who signed in
3. Review AI results with confidence levels
4. Manually enter or override counts if needed
5. Add notes about sheet quality or issues
6. View uploaded images and counts in the app

### What the System Does

1. **Image Processing**: Compresses images to reduce storage
2. **AI Analysis**: Uses Google Gemini to count students
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Rates analysis quality (high/medium/low)
4. **Data Storage**: Saves images and counts to Google Sheets
5. **Audit Trail**: Tracks who entered data and when

### Technology Stack

```
Frontend (React)
├── SignInSheetUploadModal.jsx    # Upload UI component
├── geminiService.js              # Gemini API integration
├── imageCompression.js           # Image processing utilities
└── api-service.js                # Backend communication

├── Code.gs                       # Updated with new handlers
└── Google Sheets                 # Data storage with new columns

External Services
└── Google Gemini API             # AI image analysis
```

### Data Flow

```
1. User uploads sign-in sheet photo
   ↓
2. Frontend compresses image (max 1200x1600px, 85% quality)
   ↓
3. Image sent to Gemini API for analysis
   ↓
4. AI analyzes image and returns:
   - Student count
   - Lot identification
   - Confidence level (high/medium/low)
   - Notes about quality
   ↓
5. User reviews and confirms/edits count
   ↓
6. Data saved to Google Sheets:
   - Image (base64)
   - AI count
   - Confidence
   - Source (AI or manual)
   - Timestamp
   - User who submitted
   ↓
7. UI updates to show count and source
```

## 📈 AI Analysis Details

### Gemini Prompt Strategy

The AI is instructed to:
1. Count students who signed in (have names written)
2. Identify lot information from sheet header
3. Verify lot matches expected lot
4. Note image quality issues
5. Return structured JSON response

### Confidence Levels

**High Confidence:**
- Image is clear and well-lit
- All names are legible
- Lot information matches
- No ambiguity in count

**Medium Confidence:**
- Image is acceptable quality
- Most names are legible
- Minor issues present
- Count is likely accurate

**Low Confidence:**
- Image is blurry or dark
- Names are hard to read
- Lot info doesn't match
- Manual verification recommended

### Error Handling

- Network failures: Retry with exponential backoff
- API quota exceeded: Show friendly error, suggest manual entry
- Invalid response: Fall back to manual entry
- Image too large: Automatic compression
- Unsupported format: Clear error message

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path**
   - Upload clear image
   - AI returns high confidence count
   - User confirms and submits
   - Data saves successfully

2. **Manual Override**
   - Upload image
   - AI returns incorrect count
   - User overrides with manual entry
   - Both values stored

3. **Manual Entry Only**
   - User skips image upload
   - Enters count manually
   - Saves without AI analysis

4. **Error Scenarios**
   - Network failure during upload
   - API quota exceeded
   - Invalid image format
   - Image too large

5. **Permission Checks**
   - Student user cannot access feature
   - Volunteer can upload and enter
   - Admin has full access
