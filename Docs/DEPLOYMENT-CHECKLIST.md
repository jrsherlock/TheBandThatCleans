### **Step 1.2: Backup Current Code (Optional but Recommended)**
- [ ] Select ALL code in Code.gs (Cmd+A or Ctrl+A)
- [ ] Copy it
- [ ] Paste into a text file named `Code.gs.backup`
- [ ] Save the backup file somewhere safe

### **Step 1.3: Replace Code**
- [ ] Open `/Users/sherlock/TBTC-MVP/Code.gs` in a text editor

### **Step 3.6: Run Test 4 - Fetch Data**
- [ ] Click "Fetch Lot Data" button
- [ ] Wait for result
- [ ] **Expected:** Green success message showing lots with Drive URLs
- [ ] **Expected:** See the TEST1 lot with its Drive image URL

**‚úÖ All tests passed? Deployment successful!**

## üéØ **Part 4: Test in Your App (Optional)**

### **Step 4.1: Start Your App**

## ‚ùå **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: Test 1 fails (GET request)**
**Possible causes:**
- [ ] Wrong deployment URL
- [ ] Script not deployed
- [ ] Spreadsheet ID incorrect

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the deployment URL is correct
2. Check that you clicked "Deploy" (not just "Save")
3. Try accessing the URL directly in browser

---

### **Problem: Test 2 fails (POST/CORS)**
**Possible causes:**
- [ ] Didn't create NEW deployment
- [ ] Old deployment URL being used
- [ ] Code.gs not updated

**Solutions:**
1. Create a NEW deployment (not update existing)
2. Copy the NEW deployment URL
3. Update api-service.js with NEW URL
4. Verify Code.gs has the updated createJsonResponse function

---

### **Problem: Test 3 fails (Drive upload)**
**Possible causes:**
- [ ] Drive permissions not authorized
- [ ] Image too large
- [ ] Network timeout

**Solutions:**
1. In Apps Script, run function `getOrCreateImageFolder` manually
2. Authorize permissions when prompted
3. Try with a smaller image (<1MB)
4. Check Apps Script logs (View ‚Üí Logs)

---

### **Problem: Drive folder not created**
**Possible causes:**
- [ ] AUTO_CREATE_FOLDER is false
- [ ] Permissions not granted

**Solutions:**
1. Manually create folder "TBTC Sign-In Sheets" in Drive
2. Or run `getOrCreateImageFolder` function in Apps Script
3. Authorize permissions

---

### **Problem: Image URL doesn't work**
**Possible causes:**
- [ ] File sharing not set correctly
- [ ] File was deleted

**Solutions:**
1. Open the file in Drive
2. Right-click ‚Üí Share
3. Change to "Anyone with the link"
4. Set permission to "Viewer"
