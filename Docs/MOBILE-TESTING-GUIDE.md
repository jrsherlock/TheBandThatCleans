# Mobile Testing Guide for iPhone

## Quick Start (Recommended Method)

### Using ngrok - Easiest Option ‚≠ê

**1. Install ngrok:**
```bash
brew install ngrok
```

**2. Start your dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**3. In a NEW terminal, start ngrok:**
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

**4. You'll see output like this:**
```
Session Status                online
Forwarding                    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
```

**5. Open the HTTPS URL on your iPhone:**
- Open Safari on your iPhone
- Type in the `https://abc123.ngrok.io` URL
- The TBTC app will load
- Click "AR Game" tab
- Click "Launch AR Game"
- Grant camera permissions
- Start playing! üéÆ

## Alternative Methods

### Method 2: Using the Helper Script

I've created a helper script to make this easier:

```bash
./test-on-mobile.sh
```

This will:
- Check if ngrok is installed
- Show your local IP address
- Give you options for testing
- Start ngrok tunnel if you choose

---

### Method 3: Local Network (HTTP - Limited AR)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This provides HTTP, not HTTPS. WebXR AR may not work fully without HTTPS.

**1. Find your Mac's IP address:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```
Look for something like `192.168.1.x` or `10.0.0.x`

**2. Start dev server with host flag:**
```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```

**3. On your iPhone:**
- Connect to the same WiFi network as your Mac
- Open Safari
- Go to `http://192.168.1.x:3000` (use your actual IP)

**Limitations:**
- AR features may not work (WebXR requires HTTPS)
- Good for testing UI/layout only

---

### Method 4: Local HTTPS (Most Professional)

This sets up a real HTTPS certificate for local development.

**1. Install mkcert:**
```bash
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
```

**2. Create certificates:**
```bash
cd /Users/sherlock/TBTC-MVP
mkcert localhost 192.168.1.* 10.0.0.* 172.16.0.*
```

This creates:
- `localhost+3.pem` (certificate)
- `localhost+3-key.pem` (private key)

**3. The vite.config.js is already updated** to use these certificates automatically!

**4. Find your Mac's IP:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

**5. Restart dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see it's now running on HTTPS!

**6. On your iPhone:**
- Connect to same WiFi
- Open Safari
- Go to `https://192.168.1.x:3000` (use your actual IP)
- You'll see a certificate warning
- Tap "Show Details" ‚Üí "visit this website"
- Tap "Visit Website" again
- The app will load with HTTPS! ‚úÖ

**7. Trust the certificate (one-time setup):**
- On iPhone: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí About ‚Üí Certificate Trust Settings
- Enable full trust for the mkcert certificate

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"

**Problem:** iPhone can't reach your Mac

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
2. Check your Mac's firewall settings:
   - System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Firewall
   - Click "Firewall Options"
   - Ensure "Block all incoming connections" is OFF
3. Try ngrok instead (works from any network)

### "This site can't provide a secure connection"

**Problem:** HTTPS certificate issues

**Solutions:**
1. Use ngrok (automatically provides valid HTTPS)
2. Or follow the mkcert setup above
3. Or accept the certificate warning on iPhone

### "Camera access denied"

**Problem:** Safari won't request camera permissions

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're using HTTPS (not HTTP)
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Ask
3. Clear Safari data and try again
4. Try in a private browsing tab

### "AR not supported"

**Problem:** WebXR not available

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for WebXR)
2. Use Safari on iOS (not Chrome)
3. Ensure iOS 14.5 or later
4. Check that your iPhone supports ARKit (iPhone 6S or newer)

### ngrok URL changes every time

**Problem:** The ngrok URL is different each time you restart

**Solutions:**
1. Keep ngrok running while testing
2. Or sign up for a free ngrok account to get a static domain
3. Or use the local HTTPS method instead
