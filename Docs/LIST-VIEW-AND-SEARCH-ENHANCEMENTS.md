# List View and Search Enhancements

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the Parking Lots screen to add missing functionality to the List View and implement real-time search across both Card and List views.

## 1. List View Feature Parity

### Problem
The List View in the Parking Lots tab lacked key features that existed in the Card View:
- No status dropdown to change lot status
- No sign-in sheet upload button
- Users had to switch to Card View to perform these actions

### Solution
Added full feature parity between Card View and List View by implementing:

#### a) Lot Status Dropdown

**Desktop Table View:**
- Added "Actions" column to the table header (only visible to Directors and Parent Volunteers)
- Added inline status dropdown for each lot row
- Dropdown shows current status and all other available statuses
- Changing status calls `handleLotStatusUpdate()` function
- Visual styling matches Card View status badges with color-coded borders and text

**Mobile List View:**
- Added status dropdown below lot details
- Full-width dropdown with same styling as desktop
- Maintains responsive design for mobile devices

**Implementation Details:**
```jsx
{canEdit && onStatusChange && (
  <select
    value={lot.status}
    onChange={(e) => onStatusChange(lot.id, e.target.value)}
    className={`
      text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded border-2 font-medium
      ${getStatusCardColors(lot.status).buttonBorder}
      ${getStatusCardColors(lot.status).buttonText}
      ...
    `}
  >
    <option value={lot.status}>{getStatusLabel(lot.status)}</option>
    {statuses.filter(s => s !== lot.status).map(status => (
      <option key={status} value={status}>
        {getStatusLabel(status)}
      </option>
    ))}
  </select>
)}
```

#### b) Sign-In Sheet Upload Button

**Desktop Table View:**
- Added upload button in the "Actions" column
- Icon-only button with green background
- Tooltip shows "Upload Sign-In Sheet"
- Clicking opens the same `SignInSheetUploadModal` used in Card View

**Mobile List View:**
- Added upload button below lot details (next to status dropdown)
- Full button with icon and "Upload" text
- Maintains responsive design

**Implementation Details:**
```jsx
{canUploadSignInSheets && onUploadClick && (
  <button
    onClick={() => onUploadClick(lot.id)}
    className="p-1.5 rounded-lg bg-green-100 dark:bg-green-900/40 text-green-700 dark:text-green-300 hover:bg-green-200 dark:hover:bg-green-900/60 transition-colors"
    aria-label={`Upload sign-in sheet for ${lot.name}`}
    title="Upload Sign-In Sheet"
  >
    <Upload size={16} />
  </button>
)}
```

### Permissions
- **Status Dropdown:** Only visible to users with `canEditLotStatus` permission (Directors)
- **Upload Button:** Only visible to users with `canUploadSignInSheets` permission (Directors and Parent Volunteers)
- **Students:** See read-only List View without actions column

## 2. Real-Time Search Functionality

### Problem
Users had no way to quickly find specific lots by name, especially when managing 21 parking lots across multiple zones.

### Solution
Implemented a real-time search feature that filters lots as the user types.

#### Search Input UI

**Location:** Above the lot display area, below the view toggle buttons

**Features:**
- Search icon on the left side
- Clear button (X icon) on the right side when text is entered
- Placeholder text: "Search lots by name..."
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

**Implementation:**
```jsx
<div className="relative">
  <div className="absolute inset-y-0 left-0 pl-3 flex items-center pointer-events-none">
    <Search size={18} className="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500" />
  </div>
  <input
    type="text"
    value={searchQuery}
    onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
    placeholder="Search lots by name..."
    className="w-full pl-10 pr-10 py-2 border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 bg-white dark:bg-gray-700 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 dark:focus:ring-blue-400 focus:border-transparent"
  />
  {searchQuery && (
    <button
      onClick={() => setSearchQuery("")}
      className="absolute inset-y-0 right-0 pr-3 flex items-center text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600 dark:hover:text-gray-300"
      aria-label="Clear search"
    >
      <X size={18} />
    </button>
  )}
</div>
```

#### Search Behavior

**Real-Time Filtering:**
- Filters lots on every keystroke (no submit button needed)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Matches against lot name field
- Results update immediately

**Search Logic:**
```jsx
const filteredLots = useMemo(() => {
  return lots.filter(lot => {
    // ... other filters ...
    
    // Search filter - case-insensitive match on lot name
    const searchMatch = searchQuery.trim() === "" || 
      lot.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());
    
    return sectionMatch && statusMatch && priorityMatch && searchMatch;
  });
}, [lots, sectionFilter, statusFilter, priorityFilter, searchQuery]);
```

**Search Scope:**
- **Card View:** Filters displayed lot cards
- **List View:** Filters displayed lot rows (desktop table and mobile list)
- **Map View:** Search input hidden (not applicable to map)

**State Persistence:**
- Search query persists when switching between Card and List views
- Allows users to search in one view and switch to another without losing results
- Cleared when "Clear All Filters" button is clicked

#### Empty States

**Enhanced empty state messages:**
- When search query is active: `No lots found matching "{searchQuery}"`
- When filters are active but no search: `No lots match the current filters.`

**Example:**
```jsx
{filteredLots.length === 0 && (
  <div className="text-center py-12">
    <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
      {searchQuery ? `No lots found matching "${searchQuery}"` : 'No lots match the current filters.'}
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Clear All Filters

**Updated behavior:**
- "Clear All Filters" button now also clears the search query
- Button appears when any filter OR search query is active
- Single click resets all filters and search to default state

```jsx
{(sectionFilter !== "all" || statusFilter !== "all" || priorityFilter !== "all" || searchQuery !== "") && (
  <div className="mt-3">
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setSectionFilter("all");
        setStatusFilter("all");
        setPriorityFilter("all");
        setSearchQuery("");
      }}
      className="px-4 py-2 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-200 dark:hover:bg-gray-600 transition-colors text-sm"
    >
      Clear All Filters
    </button>
  </div>
)}
```

## 3. Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**src/components/ParkingLotsScreen.jsx:**
- Added `Search` and `X` icons to imports
- Added `searchQuery` state variable
- Updated `filteredLots` useMemo to include search filtering
- Added search input UI above filters
- Updated `LotListView` component signature to accept `onUploadClick` prop
- Added permission checks for `canUploadSignInSheets`
- Added "Actions" column to desktop table header
- Added status dropdown and upload button to desktop table rows
- Added status dropdown and upload button to mobile list items
- Updated empty states to show search query
- Updated "Clear All Filters" button to clear search query
- Passed `onUploadClick` prop to `LotListView` component

### State Management

**New State:**
```jsx
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
```

**Updated Dependencies:**
```jsx
const filteredLots = useMemo(() => {
  // ... filtering logic ...
}, [lots, sectionFilter, statusFilter, priorityFilter, searchQuery]);
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Filtering:** Uses `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-filtering
- **Debouncing:** Not implemented (not needed for 21 lots)
- **Search Complexity:** O(n) where n = number of lots (21)
- **Real-Time Updates:** Instant feedback on every keystroke

---

## 4. User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users had to scroll through all 21 lots to find a specific one
- List View was read-only for status changes and uploads
- Users had to switch to Card View to perform actions
- No quick way to filter by lot name

### After
- Users can instantly find lots by typing part of the name
- List View has full feature parity with Card View
- Status changes and uploads can be done from any view
- Search query persists when switching views
- Clear visual feedback when no results found

### Example Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Find a specific lot**
1. User types "Hancher" in search box
2. Only "Lot 55 - Hancher" is displayed
3. User can immediately update status or upload sign-in sheet

**Use Case 2: Update multiple lots in List View**
1. User switches to List View for compact display
2. User can see all lots in a table format
3. User can change status for multiple lots without switching views
4. User can upload sign-in sheets directly from the table

**Use Case 3: Search and switch views**
1. User searches for "Jail" in Card View
2. Only "Lot 11 - Jail Lot" is displayed
3. User switches to List View
4. Search query persists, still showing only "Lot 11 - Jail Lot"

## 5. Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation
- Search input is fully keyboard accessible
- Tab navigation works correctly
- Enter key does not submit (real-time filtering)
- Escape key can be used to clear search (via clear button)

### Screen Readers
- Search input has proper label: "Search Lots"
- Clear button has aria-label: "Clear search"
- Status dropdowns have aria-label: "Change status for {lot name}"
- Upload buttons have aria-label: "Upload sign-in sheet for {lot name}"

### Visual Indicators
- Search icon provides visual context
- Clear button (X) appears only when text is entered
- Focus states clearly visible on all interactive elements
- Color-coded status dropdowns match Card View styling

---

## 6. Dark Mode Support

All new UI elements support dark mode:
- Search input background and text colors
- Search icon color
- Clear button hover states
- Status dropdown styling
- Upload button styling
- Empty state text colors
