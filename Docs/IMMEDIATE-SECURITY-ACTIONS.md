## üî• IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do These Now - 10 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Verify Old Key is Deleted**

1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Confirm the old key `AIzaSyCWaIctac3h52sMEZ0SCMu5PuFrm6hMLEs` is **deleted**
3. If still visible, click the trash icon to delete it immediately

### **Step 2: Update Your Local .env File**

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/sherlock/TBTC-MVP

# Edit .env file (use your preferred editor)
nano .env

# Replace the content with:
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...your_new_key_from_screenshot
VITE_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp

# Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter in nano)
```

**IMPORTANT:** Replace `AIza...your_new_key_from_screenshot` with the actual key ending in `...XcNc` from your screenshot.

### **Step 3: Add API Key to Vercel**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - URL: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Or: https://vercel.com/jrsherlock

2. **Select Your Project:**
   - Click on "TheBandThatCleans" or "TBTC-MVP"

3. **Navigate to Environment Variables:**
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Environment Variables" in left sidebar

4. **Add New Variable:**
   - Click "Add New" button
   - **Key:** `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `AIza...your_new_key_from_screenshot` (the one ending in ...XcNc)
   - **Environments:** Check all three boxes:
     - ‚úÖ Production
     - ‚úÖ Preview
     - ‚úÖ Development
   - Click "Save"

### **Step 4: Restrict API Key in Google AI Studio**

1. **Go to API Keys Page:**
   - URL: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

2. **Click on Your New Key:**
   - The one ending in `...XcNc`
   - Click the key name or the edit icon

3. **Add Application Restrictions:**
   - Select "HTTP referrers (websites)"
   - Click "Add an item"
   - Add these referrers (one at a time):
     ```
     https://*.vercel.app/*
     http://localhost:3000/*
     http://localhost:5173/*
     ```
   - Click "Done"

4. **Add API Restrictions:**
   - Select "Restrict key"
   - Find and enable: "Generative Language API"
   - Disable all other APIs
   - Click "Save"

### **Step 5: Redeploy Your Application**

**Option A: Trigger Redeploy via Git (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/sherlock/TBTC-MVP
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: Trigger redeploy with secured API key"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Redeploy via Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Find the latest deployment
4. Click the "..." menu
5. Click "Redeploy"
6. Confirm the redeploy

### **Step 6: Verify Everything Works**

1. **Wait for Deployment to Complete:**
   - Check Vercel dashboard for "Ready" status
   - Usually takes 1-2 minutes

2. **Test Locally:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sherlock/TBTC-MVP
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Navigate to Parking Lots screen
   - Try uploading a sign-in sheet
   - Verify Gemini analysis works

3. **Test in Production:**
   - Go to your Vercel deployment URL
   - Navigate to Parking Lots screen
   - Try uploading a sign-in sheet
   - Verify Gemini analysis works

## üîç Verification Checklist

After completing the above steps, verify:

- [ ] Old API key (`AIzaSyCWaIctac3h52sMEZ0SCMu5PuFrm6hMLEs`) is deleted from Google AI Studio
- [ ] New API key (`...XcNc`) is in your local `.env` file
- [ ] New API key is in Vercel environment variables (all 3 environments)
- [ ] API key has HTTP referrer restrictions applied
- [ ] API key is restricted to "Generative Language API" only
- [ ] Application redeployed successfully
- [ ] Sign-in sheet upload works locally
- [ ] Sign-in sheet upload works in production
- [ ] No errors in browser console

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

### **Understanding the Security Risk**

Even after these steps, your API key will still be **visible in the client-side JavaScript bundle** because of the `VITE_` prefix. This is a fundamental limitation of Vite's environment variable system.

**What this means:**
- ‚úÖ API key restrictions prevent unauthorized domains from using it
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting prevents excessive usage
- ‚ùå Anyone can still extract the key from your JavaScript files
- ‚ùå They can use it from allowed domains (your Vercel app)

**This is acceptable for:**
- ‚úÖ Development and testing
- ‚úÖ Low-traffic applications
- ‚úÖ Internal tools with limited users

**This is NOT acceptable for:**
- ‚ùå High-traffic production applications
- ‚ùå Public-facing apps with many users
- ‚ùå Applications handling sensitive data

### **For Production Security**

If you need production-grade security, you must implement one of these solutions:

1. **Google Cloud Platform + Backend Proxy** (Best)
   - API key never exposed to client
   - Full control over access and quotas
   - See: `SECURITY-GEMINI-API-KEY-SETUP.md` ‚Üí Option 1

2. **Google Apps Script Proxy** (Good)
   - API key stored in Apps Script properties
   - Frontend calls Apps Script, which calls Gemini
   - See: `SECURITY-GEMINI-API-KEY-SETUP.md` ‚Üí Option 3

## üìä What You've Accomplished

After completing these steps:

‚úÖ **Removed exposed key from Git repository**
‚úÖ **Secured new API key with restrictions**
‚úÖ **Configured Vercel environment variables**
‚úÖ **Redeployed application with secure configuration**
‚úÖ **Verified functionality works**

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "API key not valid" error**

**Solution:**
1. Verify API key is correct in Vercel environment variables
2. Check that you redeployed after adding the variable
3. Verify API key restrictions allow your domain

### **Issue: "Gemini API not configured" warning**

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file has `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=...`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### **Issue: Works locally but not in production**

**Solution:**
1. Verify Vercel environment variable is set for "Production"
2. Check API key restrictions include `*.vercel.app`
3. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors

### **Issue: "Quota exceeded" error**

**Solution:**
1. Check usage in Google AI Studio dashboard
2. Google AI Studio has 60 requests/minute limit
3. Consider implementing rate limiting in your app
4. For higher limits, migrate to Google Cloud

---

## üìû Next Steps After Securing

1. **Monitor Usage:**
   - Check Google AI Studio dashboard regularly
   - Watch for unusual activity
   - Set up alerts if available

2. **Plan for Production:**
   - Review `SECURITY-GEMINI-API-KEY-SETUP.md`
   - Choose long-term security solution
   - Schedule implementation

3. **Document for Team:**
   - Share security guide with team members
   - Establish API key rotation policy
   - Create incident response plan

## ‚úÖ Completion

Once you've completed all steps above, your API key is as secure as possible with the current architecture. 

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes

**Status:** üü° Secured (with known limitations)

**Recommended Next Step:** Plan migration to Google Cloud or Apps Script proxy for production-grade security.
