## Visual Inspection Checklist

### 1. Status Color Coding

Each lot card should display with a colored border and background tint matching its status:

| **Not Started** | Gray | Light gray | Gray |
| **In Progress** | Blue | Light blue | Blue |
| **Needs Help** | Red | Light red | Red |
| **Pending Approval** | Yellow | Light yellow | Yellow |
| **Complete** | Green | Light green | Green |

**How to Test:**
- [ ] Create or find lots with each of the 5 status values

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Colors look washed out in dark mode
**Solution:** Adjust opacity of background tints (e.g., `dark:bg-blue-900/10` → `dark:bg-blue-900/20`)

### Issue: Status buttons too small on mobile
**Solution:** Verify `min-h-[44px]` class is applied

### Issue: Text not readable on colored backgrounds
**Solution:** Check contrast ratio, adjust text color or background color

### Issue: Animations are janky
**Solution:** Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled, reduce animation complexity

### Issue: Focus ring not visible
**Solution:** Check `focus:ring-2` class is applied, verify ring color contrasts with background
