2. Enhancement of Volunteer Dashboard with interactive KPI cards

---

## Change 1: Removal of Estimated Completion Time

### Rationale
The estimated completion time feature was removed to simplify the application and eliminate potentially inaccurate time predictions.

### Files Modified

#### 1. Code.gs (Google Apps Script Backend)
**Line 19 - LOTS Schema Headers:**
- **Before:** `"id", "name", "section", "status", "priority", "estimatedTime", "totalStudentsSignedUp", ...`
- **After:** `"id", "name", "section", "status", "priority", "totalStudentsSignedUp", ...`
- **Change:** Removed `estimatedTime` field from the Lots sheet schema

**Line 729 - CSV Report Headers:**
- **Before:** `"Lot ID,Lot Name,Status,Students Signed Up,Students Present,Completion Time,Duration (min)\n"`
- **After:** `"Lot ID,Lot Name,Status,Students Signed Up,Students Present,Duration (min)\n"`
- **Change:** Removed "Completion Time" column from CSV export

**Line 741 - CSV Report Data:**
- **Before:** `csvData += \`"${lot.id}","${lot.name}","${lot.status}",${lot.totalStudentsSignedUp || 0},${studentsPresent},"${lot.completedTime || 'N/A'}",${duration}\n\`;`
- **After:** `csvData += \`"${lot.id}","${lot.name}","${lot.status}",${lot.totalStudentsSignedUp || 0},${studentsPresent},${duration}\n\`;`
- **Change:** Removed completedTime from CSV data output

#### 2. app.jsx (Main Application)
**Lines 110-139 - Initial Lots Mock Data:**
- **Before:** Created `estimatedTime` variable and used it in lot initialization
- **After:** Removed `estimatedTime` variable; duration is now only used locally for completed lots
- **Change:** Removed `estimatedTime: estimatedTime` property from lot objects

**Lines 321-346 - Stats Calculation:**
- **Before:** Calculated `averageCompletionTime` and `estimatedCompletion` based on completed lots
- **After:** Removed all completion time calculations
- **Change:** Stats object no longer includes `averageCompletionTime` or `estimatedCompletion`

**Line 366 - Single Lot Status Update Handler:**
- **Before:** `updatedLot.actualStartTime = new Date(Date.now() - (l.estimatedTime || 45) * 60 * 1000);`
- **After:** `updatedLot.actualStartTime = new Date(Date.now() - 45 * 60 * 1000);`
- **Change:** Uses fixed 45-minute default instead of lot's estimatedTime

**Line 448 - Bulk Status Update Handler:**
- **Before:** `updatedLot.actualStartTime = new Date(Date.now() - (lot.estimatedTime || 45) * 60 * 1000);`
- **After:** `updatedLot.actualStartTime = new Date(Date.now() - 45 * 60 * 1000);`
- **Change:** Uses fixed 45-minute default instead of lot's estimatedTime

**Line 886 - Footer:**
- **Before:** `<p>Go Hawks! ({stats.estimatedCompletion.toLocaleTimeString()})</p>`
- **After:** `<p>Go Hawks!</p>`
- **Change:** Removed estimated completion time display from footer

#### 3. src/components/Dashboard.jsx
**Lines 176-199 - Admin Dashboard KPI Grid:**
- **Before:** 4-column grid with "Est. Completion" card showing `stats.estimatedCompletion`
- **After:** 3-column grid without estimated completion card
- **Change:** Removed the 4th KPI card that displayed estimated completion time

**Lines 367-515 - Volunteer Dashboard:**
- **Before:** 3-column KPI row with "Estimated Completion" card
- **After:** 2-column KPI row without estimated completion card
- **Change:** Removed estimated completion KPI card

**Line 8 - Imports:**
- **Before:** `import { CheckCircle, Clock, Users, MapPin, ... }`
- **After:** `import { CheckCircle, Users, MapPin, ... }`
- **Change:** Removed unused `Clock` icon import

---

## Change 2: Interactive Volunteer Dashboard KPI Cards

### Rationale
Enhanced the Volunteer Dashboard to make status KPI cards interactive, allowing volunteers to click on a status card to view all parking lots with that specific status.

### Files Modified

#### src/components/Dashboard.jsx - VolunteerDashboard Component

**New State Management (Line 372):**
```javascript
const [selectedStatus, setSelectedStatus] = useState(null);
```
- Added state to track which status card is currently selected

**New Filtered Lots Logic (Lines 383-387):**
```javascript
const filteredLots = useMemo(() => {
  if (!selectedStatus) return [];
  return lots.filter(l => l.status === selectedStatus);
}, [lots, selectedStatus]);
```
- Memoized computation to filter lots by selected status

**New Click Handler (Lines 389-391):**
```javascript
const handleStatusCardClick = (status) => {
  setSelectedStatus(selectedStatus === status ? null : status);
};
```
- Toggle behavior: clicking the same card again deselects it

**Interactive Status Cards (Lines 419-437):**
- **Before:** Static `<div>` elements displaying status counts
- **After:** Clickable `<button>` elements with:
  - `onClick` handler to toggle selection
  - Hover effects (`hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105`)
  - Visual feedback when selected (blue ring: `ring-2 ring-blue-500`)
  - "Click to hide" hint text when selected

**Filtered Lots Display Section (Lines 439-503):**
- New animated section that appears when a status is selected
- Uses `MotionDiv` with fade-in/fade-out animation
- Displays filtered lots in a responsive grid (1/2/3 columns)
- Each lot card shows:
  - Lot name and status badge
  - Section location with MapPin icon
  - Number of students signed up
  - Director's comment (if present)
  - Color-coded left border matching status color
- Empty state message when no lots match the selected status

**KPI Row Update (Lines 505-520):**
- Changed from 3-column to 2-column grid
- Removed the estimated completion time KPI card
- Kept "Total Students Participating" and "Students Present Today" cards

### User Experience Flow
1. Volunteer views the dashboard with 5 status cards (Ready, In Progress, Needs Help, Pending Approval, Complete)
2. Clicking any status card highlights it with a blue ring and shows "Click to hide" text
3. An animated section appears below showing all lots with that status
4. Each lot is displayed in a card with relevant details
5. Clicking the same card again collapses the filtered lot list
6. Clicking a different status card switches to show lots with the new status

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Verify Estimated Time Removal
1. Check that no "Estimated Completion" or "Est. Completion" text appears anywhere in the UI
2. Verify the Admin Dashboard has 3 KPI cards (not 4)
3. Verify the Volunteer Dashboard has 2 KPI cards in the bottom row (not 3)
4. Check that the footer shows "Go Hawks!" without a time
5. Verify that exported reports don't include an "Estimated Completion Time" column

### Test Case 2: Interactive Volunteer Dashboard
1. Log in as a Parent Volunteer user
2. Navigate to the Dashboard tab
3. Click on each of the 5 status cards and verify:
   - Card gets highlighted with blue ring
   - Filtered lot list appears with smooth animation
   - Only lots with the selected status are shown
   - Lot cards display correct information (name, section, students, comments)
4. Click the same card again and verify the list collapses
5. Click different status cards and verify the list updates correctly
6. Verify the feature is NOT present in Admin or Student dashboards

### Test Case 3: Data Integrity
1. Create a new lot and verify it doesn't have an `estimatedTime` field
2. Update lot status to "complete" and verify it still records `actualStartTime` and `completedTime`
3. Export a report and verify the CSV format is correct without the removed column
4. Check Google Sheets to ensure the Lots sheet doesn't have an `estimatedTime` column

## Database Schema Changes

### Google Sheets - Lots Tab
**Column Removed:** `estimatedTime` (previously column F)

**New Column Order:**
1. id
2. name
3. section
4. status
5. priority
6. totalStudentsSignedUp (moved from column G to column F)
7. comment
8. lastUpdated
9. updatedBy
10. actualStartTime
11. completedTime
12. signUpSheetPhoto

**Action Required:**
- If you have existing data in the Lots sheet, you may need to manually remove the `estimatedTime` column
- Ensure all existing lot records are updated to match the new schema

---

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:

1. **For Estimated Time Removal:**
   - Restore the `estimatedTime` field in Code.gs SHEETS.LOTS.headers
   - Restore the stats calculation logic in app.jsx (lines 341-350, 357-358)
   - Restore the KPI cards in Dashboard.jsx for both Admin and Volunteer views
   - Restore the footer time display in app.jsx
   - Add back the `Clock` import in Dashboard.jsx

2. **For Interactive Volunteer Dashboard:**
   - Remove the `selectedStatus` state and related logic
   - Change status cards back from `<button>` to `<div>` elements
   - Remove the filtered lots display section
   - Remove the click handler function

---

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible with existing lot data (lots without `estimatedTime` will work fine)
- The interactive KPI cards feature is isolated to the Volunteer Dashboard and doesn't affect other roles
- No API changes were required; all modifications are frontend-only except for the schema update
- The application continues to track `actualStartTime` and `completedTime` for completed lots, allowing duration calculations in reports

---

## Files Changed Summary

1. **Code.gs** - 2 changes (schema header, CSV export)
2. **app.jsx** - 6 changes (mock data, stats calculation, status handlers, footer)
3. **src/components/Dashboard.jsx** - 3 major changes (imports, Admin KPI grid, Volunteer Dashboard enhancement)

**Total Lines Modified:** ~150 lines across 3 files
**Total Lines Added:** ~80 lines (mostly for interactive Volunteer Dashboard)
**Total Lines Removed:** ~70 lines (mostly estimated time calculations)
