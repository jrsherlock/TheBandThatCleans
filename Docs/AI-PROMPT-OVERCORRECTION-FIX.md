# AI Prompt Overcorrection Fix - Crossed-Out Names

## Overview
This document describes the fix for the AI being overly aggressive in filtering out student names due to overly strict language in the prompt about crossed-out names, which was introduced during the unified upload workflow redesign.

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** Fixed

---

## Problem Statement

### Issue: AI Missing Valid Student Names

**Symptom:**
- AI was consistently extracting fewer student names than actually appeared on sign-in sheets
- Valid, non-crossed-out names were being skipped by the AI
- The issue started after the unified upload workflow redesign (commit 44db5f5)

**Timeline:**
1. **Before unified uploader redesign:** Student counts were 100% accurate with lot-by-lot upload
2. **After unified uploader redesign (commit 44db5f5):** Student counts became consistently inaccurate
3. **After count fix (commit f3f5218):** Count matched extracted names, but AI was still missing names during extraction

**Example:**
- **Lot:** Myrtle
- **Actual students on image:** 4 names clearly visible
- **AI extracted:** Only 3 names in `studentNames` array
- **Problem:** AI was not extracting all names, even though they were clearly written and not crossed out

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Comparison of AI Prompts

I compared the AI prompts between the old lot-by-lot workflow and the new unified bulk upload workflow:

**OLD Prompt (lot-by-lot upload) - `analyzeSignInSheet()` function:**
```javascript
IMPORTANT EXTRACTION RULES:
- If a row has a name but is crossed out or marked as invalid, do NOT extract it
```

**NEW Prompt (bulk upload) - `analyzeSignInSheetWithLotIdentification()` function:**
```javascript
IMPORTANT EXTRACTION RULES:
- **CRITICAL: Do NOT extract any names that have been crossed out, scribbled over, or otherwise marked up to indicate deletion or invalidation**
- **CRITICAL: Only extract clean, unmarked names that the person clearly intended to be counted**
- Students sometimes sign into one lot, change their mind, cross out their name, and sign into a different lot - only count them at their intended final lot
```

### The Problem

The new prompt had **overly aggressive language** about crossed-out names:

1. **Multiple CRITICAL warnings** - Made the AI overly cautious
2. **"scribbled over, or otherwise marked up"** - Too broad, caused AI to skip names with ANY marks
3. **"Only extract clean, unmarked names"** - Too strict, excluded names with minor corrections or messy handwriting
4. **Additional context about students changing minds** - Added unnecessary complexity

**Result:** The AI became too conservative and started skipping valid names that had:
- Minor corrections or edits nearby
- Messy handwriting
- Any marks or smudges near the name
- Partial erasures or overwrites

### Why This Happened

During the unified upload workflow redesign, the prompt was enhanced to handle the case where students might sign into one lot, change their mind, cross out their name, and sign into a different lot. The intent was good (avoid double-counting), but the language was too aggressive and caused the AI to skip valid names.

## Solution

### 1. Simplified and Clarified Crossed-Out Name Rules

**New Prompt Language:**
```javascript
IMPORTANT EXTRACTION RULES:
- **IMPORTANT: Only skip a name if it has a clear line drawn through it (crossed out)**
- Do NOT skip names just because they have minor marks, corrections, or messy handwriting nearby
- A name is only "crossed out" if there is an obvious horizontal or diagonal line through the entire name
- When in doubt about whether a name is crossed out, INCLUDE it in the extraction
```

**Key Changes:**
1. **Removed "CRITICAL" warnings** - Less intimidating to the AI
2. **Specific definition of "crossed out"** - "clear line drawn through it"
3. **Explicit permission to include messy names** - "Do NOT skip names just because they have minor marks"
4. **Clear guidance on edge cases** - "When in doubt, INCLUDE it"
5. **Removed vague terms** - No more "scribbled over" or "marked up"

### 2. Applied Fix to Both Functions

Updated both AI analysis functions to use the same improved language:
- `analyzeSignInSheet()` - Single lot upload (lines 92-106)
- `analyzeSignInSheetWithLotIdentification()` - Bulk upload (lines 516-529)

**Ensures consistency** across both upload workflows.

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

**src/services/geminiService.js:**

1. **Updated `analyzeSignInSheet()` prompt** (Lines 92-106):
   - Simplified crossed-out name rules
   - Added explicit permission to include names with minor marks
   - Added "when in doubt, include it" guidance
   - Removed overly aggressive "CRITICAL" warnings

2. **Updated `analyzeSignInSheetWithLotIdentification()` prompt** (Lines 516-529):
   - Same changes as above
   - Ensures consistency between single and bulk upload

### Before vs. After

**Before (Overly Aggressive):**
```javascript
- **CRITICAL: Do NOT extract any names that have been crossed out, scribbled over, or otherwise marked up to indicate deletion or invalidation**
- **CRITICAL: Only extract clean, unmarked names that the person clearly intended to be counted**
- Students sometimes sign into one lot, change their mind, cross out their name, and sign into a different lot - only count them at their intended final lot
```

**After (Balanced):**
```javascript
- **IMPORTANT: Only skip a name if it has a clear line drawn through it (crossed out)**
- Do NOT skip names just because they have minor marks, corrections, or messy handwriting nearby
- A name is only "crossed out" if there is an obvious horizontal or diagonal line through the entire name
- When in doubt about whether a name is crossed out, INCLUDE it in the extraction
```

## How It Works Now

### AI Decision Process

**When the AI sees a name on the sign-in sheet:**

1. **Is there a clear line through the entire name?**
   - YES → Skip it (it's crossed out)
   - NO → Continue to step 2

2. **Is the name clearly written (even if messy)?**
   - YES → Extract it
   - NO → Continue to step 3

3. **Can you make out most of the name?**
   - YES → Extract it with a note about unclear handwriting
   - NO → Add to illegibleNames array

4. **When in doubt:**
   - INCLUDE the name (err on the side of inclusion)

### Examples

**Scenario 1: Name with messy handwriting**
- **Before:** Skipped (too "marked up")
- **After:** ✅ Extracted (messy handwriting is OK)

**Scenario 2: Name with minor correction nearby**
- **Before:** Skipped (has "marks")
- **After:** ✅ Extracted (minor marks are OK)

**Scenario 3: Name with clear line through it**
- **Before:** ✅ Skipped (correctly identified as crossed out)
- **After:** ✅ Skipped (still correctly identified as crossed out)

**Scenario 4: Name with smudge or partial erasure**
- **Before:** Skipped (looks "scribbled over")
- **After:** ✅ Extracted (not a clear line through it)

**Scenario 5: Unclear if crossed out**
- **Before:** Skipped (when in doubt, exclude)
- **After:** ✅ Extracted (when in doubt, include)

## Expected Improvements

### Accuracy Improvements

**Before Fix:**
- AI extracted 3 out of 4 names (75% accuracy)
- Valid names with minor marks were skipped
- Messy handwriting caused names to be excluded

**After Fix:**
- AI should extract all 4 names (100% accuracy)
- Only truly crossed-out names are skipped
- Messy handwriting is tolerated

### Edge Cases Handled Better

1. **Messy Handwriting:**
   - Before: Often skipped
   - After: Extracted with note if needed

2. **Minor Corrections:**
   - Before: Caused name to be skipped
   - After: Name is extracted

3. **Smudges or Marks:**
   - Before: Triggered "marked up" filter
   - After: Ignored unless it's a clear line

4. **Partial Erasures:**
   - Before: Looked like "scribbled over"
   - After: Extracted if name is still readable

5. **Ambiguous Cases:**
   - Before: Excluded when uncertain
   - After: Included when uncertain

## Validation

### How to Verify the Fix

1. **Upload a test sign-in sheet** with known number of students
2. **Check browser console** for AI extraction logs:
   ```
   ✅ Gemini analysis complete: {
     count: 4,
     studentNames: ["Name1", "Name2", "Name3", "Name4"],
     ...
   }
   ```
3. **Verify count matches** actual number of non-crossed-out names on sheet
4. **Check for warnings** about count mismatches (should be rare now)
5. **Review extracted names** to ensure no valid names were skipped

### Success Criteria

- ✅ AI extracts all non-crossed-out names
- ✅ AI correctly skips truly crossed-out names
- ✅ AI includes names with messy handwriting
- ✅ AI includes names with minor marks or corrections
- ✅ Count matches actual number of students on sheet
- ✅ No valid names are missing from extraction

## Comparison: Old vs. New Workflow

### Why the Old Workflow Worked Better

**Old Lot-by-Lot Upload:**
- Simple, clear rule: "If crossed out, don't extract it"
- No overly aggressive language
- AI was more permissive with messy handwriting
- Result: 100% accuracy

**New Unified Bulk Upload (Before Fix):**
- Multiple CRITICAL warnings
- Vague terms like "scribbled over" and "marked up"
- "Only extract clean, unmarked names" was too strict
- Result: Missing valid names

**New Unified Bulk Upload (After Fix):**
- Clear definition of "crossed out"
- Explicit permission to include messy names
- "When in doubt, include it" guidance
- Result: Should match old workflow accuracy

## Summary

This fix addresses the root cause of AI undercounting students by correcting overly aggressive language in the AI prompt that was introduced during the unified upload workflow redesign.

**The Problem:**
- Unified upload workflow added overly strict rules about crossed-out names
- AI became too conservative and skipped valid names with ANY marks
- Terms like "scribbled over" and "marked up" were too vague
- "Only extract clean, unmarked names" excluded messy handwriting

**The Solution:**
- Simplified crossed-out name rules to be specific and clear
- Defined "crossed out" as "clear line drawn through the entire name"
- Added explicit permission to include names with minor marks
- Added "when in doubt, include it" guidance
- Removed overly aggressive "CRITICAL" warnings

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Clear definition of what "crossed out" means
- ✅ Explicit permission to include messy handwriting
- ✅ Guidance to include names when uncertain
- ✅ Removed vague terms like "scribbled over"
- ✅ Applied to both single and bulk upload functions

**Benefits:**
- 🎯 AI extracts all valid student names
- 📝 Only truly crossed-out names are skipped
- 🔍 Messy handwriting is tolerated
- ✅ Accuracy should match old lot-by-lot workflow
- 🛡️ Still correctly handles crossed-out names

The AI should now extract all valid student names while still correctly skipping truly crossed-out names, restoring the 100% accuracy of the original lot-by-lot upload workflow.
