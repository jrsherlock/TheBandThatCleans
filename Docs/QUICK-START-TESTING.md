## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Upload Sign-In Sheet" button not visible
**Cause**: User doesn't have permission
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as a Volunteer or Director, not a Student

### Issue: "AI analysis not configured"
**Cause**: Gemini API key not set or invalid
**Solution**: 
1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
2. Verify `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
3. Restart dev server after adding `.env`

### Issue: "Failed to upload sign-in sheet"
**Cause**: Backend not deployed or URL incorrect
**Solution**:
1. Verify `googleappsscript.js` is deployed to Google Apps Script
2. Check `api-service.js` has correct `BASE_URL`
3. Test the backend URL directly in browser

### Issue: Image compression fails
**Cause**: Browser doesn't support canvas API
**Solution**: Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Issue: AI analysis takes too long
**Cause**: Large image or slow network
**Solution**: 
1. Check internet connection
2. Try with a smaller image
3. Use manual entry if timeout occurs

### Issue: Data doesn't appear in Google Sheets
**Cause**: Columns not added or backend handler not working
**Solution**:
1. Verify 6 new columns exist in Lots sheet
2. Check Google Apps Script logs for errors
3. Test backend with sample payload

## üìä Sample Test Data

### Sample Payload for Backend Testing

You can test the backend directly by sending this payload:

```javascript
{
  "type": "UPLOAD_SIGNIN_SHEET",
  "lotId": "lot-1",
  "aiCount": 11,
  "aiConfidence": "high",
  "countSource": "ai",
  "enteredBy": "Test User",
  "notes": "Test upload from frontend",
  "imageData": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..." // truncated
}
```

### Expected Response

```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Parking Lot Cleanup Sign-in sheet uploaded successfully",
  "lotId": "lot-1",
  "studentCount": 11,
  "countSource": "ai",
  "confidence": "high",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-12T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```
