## Test Checklist

### ✅ Test 1: Admin/Director Dashboard

**Steps:**
1. Ensure you're logged in as "Director (admin)" role (check top-right dropdown)
2. Navigate to the "Dashboard" tab
3. Locate the "Overall Progress" section (should be below the KPI cards)

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] **Segmented bar is visible** instead of the old gradient bar
- [ ] **Each segment represents one lot** (should see 21 segments for 21 lots)
- [ ] **Segments are color-coded:**
  - Gray segments = Ready/Not Started
  - Blue segments = In Progress
  - Red segments = Needs Help
  - Yellow segments = Pending Approval
  - Green segments = Complete
- [ ] **Segments are grouped by status** (all blues together, all greens together, etc.)
- [ ] **Percentage is displayed** in the top-right (e.g., "33%")
- [ ] **Legend is shown below the bar** with status counts
- [ ] **Helper text** "Hover over segments to see lot details" is visible

**Visual Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Overall Progress                                        33% │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Gray][Gray][Gray] [Blue][Blue][Blue][Blue][Blue][Blue]... │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ■ Ready: 3  ■ In Progress: 8  ■ Needs Help: 1  ...        │
│ Hover over segments to see lot details                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

        │ In Progress         │
        │ 12 students         │

### ✅ Test 6: Responsive Design

**Steps:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M or Cmd+Shift+M)
3. Test these viewport sizes:
   - Desktop: 1920x1080
   - Tablet: 768x1024
   - Mobile: 375x667

**Expected Results:**

**Desktop (1920px):**
- [ ] Segments are comfortably wide
- [ ] Tooltips appear centered above segments
- [ ] Legend items are on one or two lines

**Tablet (768px):**
- [ ] Segments scale proportionally
- [ ] Bar remains horizontal
- [ ] Legend wraps to multiple lines if needed
- [ ] Tooltips still work correctly

**Mobile (375px):**
- [ ] Segments are thin but visible (minimum 4px)
- [ ] Bar remains horizontal (doesn't stack vertically)
- [ ] Legend wraps to multiple lines
- [ ] Tooltips appear but may be smaller
- [ ] Percentage is still visible

---

### ✅ Test 7: Dynamic Updates

**Steps:**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Parking Lots" tab
3. Change a lot's status (e.g., set a "Ready" lot to "In Progress")
4. Return to the "Dashboard" tab

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] **Segmented bar updates** to reflect the status change
- [ ] **Segment color changes** from gray to blue
- [ ] **Segment moves** to the "In Progress" group
- [ ] **Legend counts update** (Ready decreases, In Progress increases)
- [ ] **Percentage updates** if a lot was completed
- [ ] **Update is smooth** (no jarring jumps)

---

### ✅ Test 8: Edge Cases

**Test 8a: All Lots Same Status**
1. Imagine all 21 lots are "Complete" (or use browser console to mock this)

**Expected:**
- [ ] Bar is entirely green
- [ ] Legend shows only "Complete: 21"
- [ ] Percentage shows "100%"

**Test 8b: Only One Status Has Lots**
1. Imagine only "In Progress" has lots

**Expected:**
- [ ] Bar is entirely blue
- [ ] Legend shows only "In Progress: X"
- [ ] Other statuses don't appear in legend

**Test 8c: Empty State (No Lots)**
1. If possible, test with 0 lots (may need to mock)

**Expected:**
- [ ] Shows "No lots available" message
- [ ] Percentage shows "0%"
- [ ] No segments or legend

---

### ✅ Test 9: Legend Accuracy

**Steps:**
1. On any dashboard, count the segments of each color manually
2. Compare with the legend counts

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] **Gray segments** = "Ready: X" in legend
- [ ] **Blue segments** = "In Progress: X" in legend
- [ ] **Red segments** = "Needs Help: X" in legend
- [ ] **Yellow segments** = "Pending Approval: X" in legend
- [ ] **Green segments** = "Complete: X" in legend
- [ ] **Total segments** = Total lots (e.g., 21)
- [ ] **Statuses with 0 lots** don't appear in legend

---

### ✅ Test 10: Comparison with Old Design

**What Changed:**
- ✅ **Before**: Simple gradient bar (blue to green)
- ✅ **After**: Segmented bar with individual lot representation

**Benefits Verified:**
- [ ] Can see **exact number of lots** in each status
- [ ] Can identify **which lots need help** (red segments)
- [ ] Can see **workflow progression** (left to right grouping)
- [ ] Can get **individual lot details** via hover
- [ ] **More information** without taking more space

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Segments Too Small
**Symptom:** With many lots (50+), segments are very thin
**Expected:** This is normal. Minimum width is 4px to ensure visibility
**Solution:** Hover tooltips provide detailed information

### Issue 2: Tooltip Cut Off at Edges
**Symptom:** Tooltips at far left/right are partially off-screen
**Expected:** Tooltip should auto-position to stay on screen
**Fix Needed:** If this occurs, may need to adjust tooltip positioning logic

### Issue 3: Colors Not Matching Status
**Symptom:** A "Complete" lot shows as blue instead of green
**Expected:** All segments should match their lot's current status
**Solution:** Check that lot status is correctly set in data

### Issue 4: Legend Counts Don't Match
**Symptom:** Legend shows "In Progress: 8" but only 7 blue segments visible
**Expected:** Counts should always match
**Solution:** Check for data inconsistencies or rendering issues

### Issue 5: No Tooltips on Mobile
**Symptom:** Tooltips don't appear when tapping on mobile
**Expected:** Hover events may not work on touch devices
**Enhancement Needed:** Add tap/touch event handlers for mobile
